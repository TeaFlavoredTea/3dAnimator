============================ OVERVIEW ============================
This is a java application that loads a model, then lets a user select parts of the model and rotate them.
The user can chain together model poses into animations using a GUI.

This application was written using Processing Language (PL) in java. 
PL is a free and open-source graphics library built on openGL. 
You can download the PL IDE from:  https://processing.org/download/
PL files have extension “.pde” and can be opened as text files.


======================= RUNNING THE APPLICATION =======================
 1) Install the PL IDE from "https://processing.org/download/".
 2) Pull the github repository.
 3) Open file "assignmnet3.pde" with the PL IDE.
 4) run the script (ctrl + r).

============================== USE ==============================
 * Look around by right-clicking and dragging the mouse.
 * View joints by pressing and holding 'r'.
 * Select a joint by pressing 'r' and left clicking it. Unselect in the same way.
	The selected joint will appear cyan.
