============================ OVERVIEW ============================
This is a java application that loads a model, then lets a user select parts of the model and rotate them.
The user can chain together model poses into animations using a GUI.

This application was written using Processing Language (PL) in java. 
PL is a free and open-source graphics library built on openGL. 
You can download the PL IDE from:  https://processing.org/download/
PL files have extension “.pde” and can be opened as text files.

This application runs on Java 8. Java is embedded in the windows distributions, but not Linux.
Linux users may need to install Java from: https://www.java.com/en/download/
